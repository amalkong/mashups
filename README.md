## Welcome to Amalkong Code-Mashups Projects

This is a personal hobby of mine, where I tend to "code surf" <small style="font-size:60%;">(for lack of a better word)</small>, and when I find useful code snippets or small projects, I usually try to build something from them.

## Mashups List
- [Traversy Mashups](https://amalkong.github.io/mashups/traversy_media_mashup/) codes from [Taversy Media](https://github.com/bradtraversy)
- [Web Dev Simplified Mashups](https://amalkong.github.io/mashups/web_dev_simplified_mashup) codes from [Web Dev Simplified](https://github.com/webdevsimplified)

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/amalkong/mashups/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/amalkong/mashups/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
