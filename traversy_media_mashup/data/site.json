Python claims to '[combine] remarkable power with very clear syntax',[7] and its standard library is large and comprehensive. Its use of indentation for block delimiters is unique among popular programming languages. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, primarily but not limited to object-oriented,imperative and, to a lesser extent, functional programming styles. It features a fully dynamic type system and automatic memory management, similar to that of Scheme, Ruby, Perl, and Tcl. Like other dynamic languages, Python is often used as a scripting language, but is also used in a wide range of non-scripting contexts.",

Larry Wall continues to oversee development of the core language, and its upcoming version, Perl 6.

It is <br />mostly used for computer code. It offers all of the distribution version control and source code managenement (SCM) functionality of Git <br />as well as adding its own features. It provides <a href='https://wikipedia.org/wiki/access_control' target='_blank'>access control</a> and several collaboration features such as bug traacking, feature resquests, <br />task managenement, and <a href='https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki' target='_blank'>wikis</a> for every project. Github offers plans for both <br />private repositories and free accounts which are comoly used to host <a href='https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software' target='_blank'>open-source</a> software projects.<br />As of June 2018, Github reports having over 28 million users and 57 million <a href='https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Repository_(version_control)' target='_blank'>repositories</a> (including 28 million public repositories), <br />making it the largest host of <a href='https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code' target='_blank'>source code</a> in the world.<br /><br />I have some apprehensions about this sale (which is reported to be about $7.5 Billion) because i'm not a big fan of microsoft and I can't seem to shake the feeling they are going to change the core model of github into a model more commercially driven towards their financial gain.<br />I have been surfing around the net and found that there are others who share my concerns and there seems to be even a <a href='https://github.com/upend/IF_MS_BUYS_GITHUB_IMMA_OUT' target='_blank'>movement on github itself to evacuate</a>.<br /><br /><span class='font-small'>This excerp was taken from <a href='https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Github' target='_blank'>wikipedia &not;</a></span><br />There have been concerns fro developers such as Kyle Simpson, Javascript trainer and author and Rafael Laguna, CEO at <a href='https://open-xchange.com' target='_blank'>Open-Xchange</a> <span class='font-small'>(<a href='https://Open-Xchange' target='_blank'>wiki:Open-Xchange</a>)</span> over Microsoft's purchase, <br />citing uneasiness over Microsoft's handling of previous acquisitions, such as <a href='https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Mobile' target='_blank'>Nokia mobile business</a> or <a href='https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype' target='_blank'>skype</a>.<br />Some saw this as a culmination of Microsoft's recent changes in business trategy under CEO Satya Nadella, shich has seen a larger focus on the sale of cloud computing services as it's main line of business alongside development of and contributions to open source software (such as <a href='https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux' target='_blank'>Linux</a>), <br />as opposed to the <a href='https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows' target='_blank'>Microsoft Windows</a> operating system. It is argued by some that Microsoft was intending to acquire Github to get access to its userbase, so it can be used as a <a href='https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_Leader' target='_blank'>loss leader</a> to <br />encourage use of its other development products and services.<br /><br />As stated previously, this sale has not gone well with some user and this has led to bolstered interest in some of github's main competitors such as <a href='https://bitbucket.org' target='_blank'>Bitbucket</a>, <a href='https://gitlab.com' target='_blank'>GitLab</a> and <a href='https://sourceforge.net' target='_blank'>SourceForge</a>.<br />They have reported that they had seen spikes in new users intending to migrate projects from github to their respective services.<br />Now me personally, I don't plan on going anywhere anytime soon unless i'm left no other choice and I suspect the sentiment is the same for a majority of github users.<br />For a different look into the sale I suggest <a href='https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/06/everyone-complaining-about-microsoft-buying-github-needs-to-offer-a-better-solution' target='_blank'>reading this article</a> <br /></span></p>",

Really!</strong><br />Have you ever had something for example an electronic gadget and for some reason it starts to malfunction <br />or die altogether? Have you ever wondered what caused that, well I did and probably you have so.... I did some digging and this is what I found; I came across this word: Obsolescence.</p><p><strong>What does that mean?</strong><br /><blockquote>'Obsolescence is the state of being which occurs when an object, service, or practice is no longer wanted'</blockquote><br /><br />I further found out there are different types also; Technical, Functional, Architectural, Style and Planned. <br />After seeing this list the most obvious one I thought that caused the problem I am having would be Planned Obsolescence.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><strong>What does this mean?</strong><br />This is from <a href='https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsolescence'>wikipedia</a> taken from the main article: <a href='https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence'>Planned Obsolescence</a><br />&nbsp;<blockquote>'Sometimes marketers deliberately introduce <a href='https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsolescence'>obsolescence</a> into their product strategy, with the objective of generating long-term sales <br />&nbsp;volume by reducing the time between repeat purchases. One example might be producing an appliance which is deliberately <br />&nbsp;designed to wear out within five years of its purchase pushing consumers to replace it within five years.'</blockquote><br /><br />Going off what is said, it would seem that no matter how you take care a product, it is going to fail and that's just f@*#ked up.</p>",
