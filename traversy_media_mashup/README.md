## Traversy Media Mashups

These are a compilation or mashups of snippets and small coding projects from [@traversymedia](https://github.com/bradtraversy) github repositories.

The original code base which inspired this project can be found in the <code>old/</code> folder. The general style and layout used in the overhaul was <span style="text-decoration:strikethrough;"></span>inspired by [this site:jacklmoore.com](https://www.jacklmoore.com/)
